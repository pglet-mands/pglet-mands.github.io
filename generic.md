Hey Mandu, A very happy birthday to you bud. You know how special you are? Bataya tha na spl>1. Always remember that. Always. No matter what.

And by the way you really have changed so much. I am happy to see you like this. Phele kaise akward sa ho jata tha tu yr. Aur ab dekho bhai terko. Kya hi alag level baaten karne lga hai. It's so nice to see you grow like this. Mast FinMech phoda. Yaad haina kya bola tha mene. Bas ek chance. That's all what it takes. And this sem CG kya mast machaya re. I told you na. I belive in you. 

I must admit, you are extremely hardworking. Terese itni baaten hoti hain, but I still don't how do you manage everything. Ek toh 10 hazar tere dost hain. Sath me axlr8r bhi tha. Thank god not anymore. But really, you are so driven, so passionate, I just love your energy.

And listen, if you ever face any problem come directly to me. I have all the rermedies as well as solutions to all your problems.

I am not very good at expressing myself yr. So I think sometimes how bad you must feel. But believe me, you have taught me a lot. I am a lot more expressive now than I was a few years ago. But still I feel that most of the times I fail to express. And the is evident from the fact Dekh kaisa weird sa gift de rha hoon terko. Ek website. Lol. Aisa kon hi deta hai gift. I am weird yr. Sorry re. üòû

But maybe isliye we are such good friends.

I don't know tere jaise mast poetry skills, ICSE. But bhai feelings sammjh re. I know you'll get what I am saying. Just telling you how much special you are be.

U know terse itni baaten hoti hai ki i don't even have a new thing to tell you. Terko  sab phele se pta hota hai. Dekh rhi ise bolte hain close friends.

Dekh bhai me toh aisa hi pglet hoon. Stay my friend always. Love you ‚ô•üíì‚ù§üß°
